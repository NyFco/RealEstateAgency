Back on C++ BABY :D

This is a training of OOP in C++, also a project for my university lesson( Advanced programming )

You can find the persian description of the project in a file named "Description".

--------------------------------------

'Inheritance', 'Operator overloading', 'Dynamic memory allocation' and 'Files in c++' are some of the methods that are used in this project.
