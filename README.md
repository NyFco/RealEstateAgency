# RealEstateAgency

Back on C++ BABY :D

This is a training of OOP in C++, also a project for my university lesson( Advanced programming )

As an input to the RealEstateAgency class in the main function you can pass an address of a text file which must follow the same rule of the text file named "real-estate-info.txt" and the program is going to log all the data about the members of your real estate agency.

The "real-estate-info.txt" includes the data of your real estate agency members.

You can find the full description of the project in persian as a file named "Description".

--------------------------------------

'Inheritance', 'Operator overloading', 'Dynamic memory allocation', 'Files in c++', 'Friend classes' and 'Polymorphism' are some of the methods that are used in this project.
